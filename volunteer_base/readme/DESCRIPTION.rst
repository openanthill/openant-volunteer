This is the base module for volunteer management in nonprofit organisatios.
Due to its basic character this module doesn't add functionality for end users, but implements
basic elements which other modules can build on.

These elements are volunteer projects. Volunteer projects are projects an organisation needs voluntary
support for. The module helps to create relations between projects and volunteers engaging in these projects.

Furthermore cancel and on-hold reasons for volunteer engagements can be defined.
