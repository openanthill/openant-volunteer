This is the base module for volunteer management in a nonprofit organisation.
Due to it's base character this module doesn't add functionality for end usere's, but implements
basic elements which other modules can build on.

These elements are volunteers, volunteer projects which are projects an organisation needs volunteer
support for and engagements which represent a relation between the two before mentioned.

To get some real features, you should install the *volunteer* module.
